***Detailed description of the variables on tidyData.txt dataset***

All variables (except subject_id and activity) were obtained by averaging the measurements of each variable for each subject

All variables (except subject_id and activity) have been normalized, ranging from -1 to 1

All the code used to obtain these results from the raw data is available on run_analysis.R script
